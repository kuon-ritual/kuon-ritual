I'm learning how to code. This is my progress tracker and is less so a portfolio and more a series of markers to indicate my growth.
I'm a business student. I have no previous experience in this field. I have no intentions of breaking into the industry (yet), but I have a strong passion for personal growth and this is part of my growth journey.
I hope I can fall in love with this pursuit.

:> I'll do my best.
